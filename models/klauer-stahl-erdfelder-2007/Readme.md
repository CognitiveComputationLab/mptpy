## Contents

- `inference-guessing.txt`
- `klauer-stahl-erdfelder-2007-agg.csv`
- `klauer-stahl-erdfelder-2007.csv`
- `studies-16patterns.csv`
- `Studies16patterns.xlsx`
- `WST-usedData.csv`

## Notes

- `WST-usedData.csv` is the datafile used by Daniel Lux while developing the first prototype of the MPT optimisation tool. We don't remember how exactly this file came to be. However, it should have be taken from `Studies16patterns.xlsx` in some way or another.
